# PDDL Seeds

These tiny PDDL domains/problems are provided for *smoke testing* planners only.

- **blocksworld** and **gripper** are canonical STRIPS domains used widely in planning research and tutorials.
- Kept intentionally minimal so CI can run them fast.

Licensing/Attribution:
- Canonical encodings appear across educational materials and open benchmarks (e.g., AIPS/IPC examples).
- These minimal files are re-authored in standard STRIPS form for interoperability and are suitable as test fixtures.
