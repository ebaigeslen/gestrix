# Gestrix

Gestrix is a research framework for **neuro-symbolic AI planning**.
It combines classical planners (e.g., Fast Downward) with modern neural/LLM reasoning to evaluate and push the boundaries of planning benchmarks like **PlanBench**.

---

## Project Goals
- Reproduce classical baselines on benchmark domains.
- Integrate neuro-symbolic methods with reproducible pipelines.
- Enable seamless execution both locally and on **Google Colab**.
- Support reproducibility via Docker, Makefiles, and CI pipelines.
